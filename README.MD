`easygraphql-now` is a node library used to create servers with mocks of the schema you pass. 

## Installation
```bash
$ npm install -g easygraphql-now
```

## Usage
To get started with the tester, you might need to follow the next steps:

### First step
+ Visit the directory with the schema to deploy.
+ Be sure you have already setup [`now`](https://zeit.co/now).
+ Run `easygraphql-now`.
+ Pass the name of the file with the schema; it must be a `.gql` or `.graphql` file.
+ It will create the server and deploy with [`now`](https://zeit.co/now), after that you will get a url with your GraphQL server.
